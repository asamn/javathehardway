PARLOR
This is the parlor.
It's a beautiful room.

There looks to be a kitchen to the "north."
To the "south" there is a long hallway.
And there's a shadowy corridor to the "east."

KITCHEN
There is a long countertop with dirty dishes everywhere. Off to one side
there is, as you'd expect, a refrigerator. You may open the "refrigerator"
or "go back."

CORRIDOR
The corridor has led to a dark room. The moment you step inside, the door
slams shut behind you. There is no handle on the interior of the door.

There is no escaping... you are likely to be eaten by a grue.

REFRIGERATOR
Inside the refrigerator you see food and stuff. It looks pretty nasty. There are two bottles of iced tea.
You can "eat" some of the food, "take" a portion of the food, or go "back."

The food is slimy and foul, but you manage to choke it down. Your stomach
starts jumping like a frog in hot water. You feel faint. Sliding to the
floor, the darkness closes in.

You come across a dead end. There is an end table in front of you with a vase of flowers.
While you admire the beauty of the flowers, you hear some unattractive breathing behind you.
You have no choice but to turn around.

RIGHT
Your face comes into contact with the hot heavy breath of the monstrosity in front of you. The horrible stench holds your nostrils hostage.
In front of you stands an anomaly of vast proportions. It can only be described as a crossbreed between a Snorlax and Amy Schumer.
Several folds and blubberly extrusions render this Lovecraftian creature as a living wall of flesh.
"FEED ME!!!" it croaks in a deep masculine voice. The entire hallway violently shakes from the 140 decibel screech.

You feel that if you had some food in your "inventory," you could try to "use" it to feed what is in front of you.
You should "go back" to see if you can find some food. The creature seems tame for now. You wonder what would happen if you "pet" it?

PETBEAST
You run your hand across the slippery skin in a friendly manner. It feels like water balloons ready to burst. The creature does not seem to
like this, and two slimy hands extrude from the folds of this creature. It grabs ahold of you and easily pierces a hole in your chest cavity.
It rips out some of your internal organs.

FEEDBEASTROTTENFOOD
You take aim and toss the rotten food into the beast's mouth. The beast gobbles it up without chewing it. A brief moment of silence- then the
beast yells in your face, "IT'S F***ING RAW!!!" The beast glows into an aggressive shade of red before momentarily combusting into a billion
tiny pieces. Blood paints the hallway about the same shade of red as seen before, except a bit more red. Behind what was once a great beast
is the reward you long for... a door out of this wretched place! Covered in blood, you make your way out to freedom.
YOU WIN!

You find a ladder and pour the iced tea into the beast's mouth. It swells up like an overinflated tire. POP! Blood and flesh and guts cover the
